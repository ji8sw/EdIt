# EdIt
A lightweight C#-WPF text editor I made as a fun little project to extend my C# portfolio. I aim to keep the code modern, structured, and readable while ensuring a working feature-set.

# Features
**Settings**
Has settings to change text wrapping and spellchecking, and the ability to switch between light and dark mode, settings save locally.

**Files**
 You can load files from your computer and edit them on the go, and once you're done you can save them.
 
**File History | NEW |**
 EdIt will remember what you've edited previously, so no need to find files you recently edited.
